This is a standalone salt installer including a salt state
which will complete all the prereqs for HP SA 9.10 on a RHEL
5.4 server.

To use it simply untar the salt_sa.tar.gz, cd into the new
directory and run install.sh. At the end of the script press
enter to reboot.

A log of the salt output is in /root/salt/sa_reqs.log

Future versions will hopefully be a bit more general but the
specific rpms used here might break newer (or older) versions
of RHEL. It has only been tested on a clean install with no
extra packages selected.
